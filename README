Plugdaemon 1.2.2

Plugdaemon is a tool that is inspired by, but not based on, the plug-gw from
Trusted Information Systems. It was originally a simpler wannabe, but the
connection balancing code makes up for it.

Not all the planned features are implemented in 1.2. Eventually plugdaemon
will provide a complete load balancing and monitoring package for servers.

Plugdaemon is released for any use, commercial or otherwise, so long as
attribution is retained.

If you do anything interesting with it, let me know.
