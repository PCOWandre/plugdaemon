.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Plugdaemon
acts as a "dumb proxy", forwarding a TCP/IP stream from a port on one host
to a possibly different port on a separate host. It runs as a daemon to
reduce latency in setting up a connection, and optionally logs every
connection via
.I syslog.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-f
Forces a given client address to continue to connect to the same host on
subsequent attempts, for proxying HTTP connections so that subsequent hits
will be on the same mirror.
.TP
-l
turns on connection logging.
.TP
-d
turns on debugging output and stops
.B plug
from running as a daemon or logging errors to syslog. Errors in this mode
are displayed on standard error.
Additional -d options add more output.
.TP
-i interface
Bind the plug to the named interface, for use on multi-homed hosts.
.TP
-t timeout
Timeout for forced connections, after no attempts in this period
it will connect to a new (pseudo-)randomly selected server. The
default is 1 hour.
.SH EXAMPLES
To proxy an NNTP connection through a firewall to a host at 10.0.3.15:
.P
plug -i 192.168.0.14 119 10.0.3.15
